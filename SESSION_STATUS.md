**Last updated:** 2026-06-18 (deployed to production: Vercel + Railway + Supabase)
**Current phase:** v1 complete AND live in production. No phase in flight.

---

## State in one line

All nine build-order phases (0–9) are done and merged to `main`, and the app is now
**live in production**: frontend on Vercel, backend on Railway, DB/Auth/Storage on
the existing Supabase project. Both hosts auto-deploy on push to `main`.

## Production (live)

- **Frontend (Vercel):** https://project-tracker-2b5a.vercel.app — root dir `client`,
  env: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (NOT the service-role key).
- **Backend (Railway):** https://project-tracker-production-6516.up.railway.app —
  root dir `server`, `npm start`, env: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `CORS_ORIGIN` + `APP_URL` (= the Vercel URL). `PORT`
  is injected by Railway.
- **Supabase:** the existing project (ref `mhrwhmhsnhvujckqjdhn`) — reused as prod;
  Auth Site URL + Redirect URLs set to the Vercel domain.
- **Login:** single admin `harsha.s@manipalgroup.info` (DB was reset to one user).
- **Deploy flow:** push to `main` → Vercel + Railway both rebuild automatically.
- **Watch-outs:** Supabase free tier pauses after ~1 week idle (un-pause in dashboard);
  Railway URL is hardcoded as `PROD_API_BASE` in `client/src/lib/api.js` (or override
  via `VITE_API_BASE_URL`); in-app user invites need custom SMTP configured in Supabase.

## Done (Phase 9 — Hardening)

- **RLS: viewers can't create projects** — migration `20260617091000_hardening.sql`
  adds `can_create_projects()` and rewrites the `projects` INSERT policy so a
  viewer is denied at the DB (not just the API). Verified: viewer direct insert →
  `42501`; member still allowed.
- **Derived-target view RLS-safe** — `project_target_dates` is now
  `security_invoker = on`. Verified: a viewer sees 0 rows, the service role sees 3.
  Mirrored into `docs/schema.sql`.
- **Audit trail (§20.2)** — admin actions write to `audit_log` via the service
  role (`audit()` helper): `user.create/update/deactivate/reactivate`,
  `mapping.add/remove`, each with actor + timestamp. Verified end-to-end.
- **§20 review pass** — findings recorded in `docs/decisions.md` (auth, permissions,
  sessions, files, text-escaping, append-only updates, dd/mm/yyyy all confirmed;
  deferrals noted). Applied via `run-sql-api.mjs` over HTTPS. Merged
  `feature/hardening` → `main`.

## What v1 includes (phases 0–9, all merged)

0 scaffolding (schema+RLS+seed) · 1 auth & shell · 2 project list · 3 detail view ·
4 detail edit · 5 files · 6 sub-projects · 7 admin users · 8 admin mappings ·
9 hardening. All verified via API + in-browser; seed data intact throughout.

## Next slice (do this session)

_None queued._ v1 build order is complete. Candidate follow-ups if work continues
(all currently in Backlog, none are v1-blocking):
- Final cross-cutting acceptance pass against PRD §22 (release scope) and the
  Appendix B acceptance scenarios, if those are in `docs/`.
- Pick up a Backlog item below, or start a deferred/future-version item (PRD §23)
  only with explicit sign-off — those are out of v1.

## Backlog (deferred; not in v1 scope unless re-prioritised)

- **Files:** wire a real (self-hosted) virus scanner behind `SCAN_ENABLED`
  (currently a stub hook that fails closed); milestone/task-scoped attachments
  (schema supports them; v1 does project-level only).
- **Admin users:** email change on edit (auth identity re-issue) — v1 read-only.
- **A11y polish:** broader keyboard nav + visible focus states (§20.4).
- **Routing:** deep-linkable URLs (real router) — v1 uses in-memory routing.
- **Audit:** surface `audit_log` in an admin UI (currently write + admin-read RLS
  only); audit project/milestone/task edits if desired (v1 scopes §20.2 to
  access/membership/mapping changes + the per-task update history).

## Blockers / open

- None. Standing note: office network blocks Postgres ports — DB tooling runs over
  HTTPS via the Management API (`server/scripts/run-sql-api.mjs`, needs
  `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`). Supabase Storage + admin (incl. auth invite) APIs work
  over HTTPS. GoTrue rejects some email domains (e.g. `example.com`).
- Dev gotcha: `node src/index.js` can leave a process on :4000 that survives
  TaskStop on Windows; if a fresh start logs `EADDRINUSE`, free the port
  (`Stop-Process` on the PID from `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 4000`).

## Branch state

- Active branch: `main` (Phase 9 merged; nothing in flight).
- Unmerged work: none.

## Useful facts for next session

- Demo password for all four seeded accounts: `DemoPass!234`. Emails: admin
  `appuser1.msc@manipalsplchem.com`, `manager.demo@…`, `member.demo@…`,
  `viewer.demo@…` (all `@manipalsplchem.com`, all `active`).
- Migrations in `supabase/migrations/` are authoritative (now 5 files, latest
  `20260617091000_hardening.sql`); `docs/schema.sql` is the human-readable mirror.
  Add a NEW migration for further DB changes; apply with
  `cd server && node scripts/run-sql-api.mjs <file.sql>` (HTTPS).
- Seed: 4 users (one per role), 1 mapping (Manager→Member), 2 top-level projects
  (Plant Safety Audit — Member; ERP Rollout — Manager) + 1 sub-project (Audit —
  Unit B), 2 milestones, 3 tasks, 2 task updates, 0 attachments.
- Run locally: API `cd server && node src/index.js` (:4000); client preview via
  `.claude/launch.json` (server `client`, :5173). Storage: `npm run setup:storage`.
  First-time DB setup: `setup:auth` then seed; `setup:storage` for the bucket.
- Full API surface (all via `requireActiveUser`; project writes also
  `canEditProject`; admin routes via `requireAdmin`): `GET /api/me`; `GET /api/users`;
  projects `GET/POST /api/projects`, `GET/PATCH /api/projects/:id`; milestones
  `POST /api/projects/:id/milestones`, `PATCH|DELETE /api/milestones/:id`; tasks
  `POST /api/projects/:id/tasks`, `PATCH|DELETE /api/tasks/:id`; updates
  `POST /api/tasks/:id/updates`; files `POST /api/projects/:id/files`,
  `GET /api/files/:id/url`, `DELETE /api/files/:id`; admin users
  `GET/POST /api/admin/users`, `PATCH /api/admin/users/:id`; admin mappings
  `GET /api/admin/mappings`, `POST /api/admin/mappings`, `DELETE /api/admin/mappings/:id`.
- Client: in-memory routing (`screens/AuthedApp.jsx`: list|detail|admin{tab}).
  Screens: ProjectList, ProjectDetail (view/edit), AdminUsers, AdminMappings.
  Components: AppShell, edit/*, Files*/FileViewerModal, TaskUpdateThread,
  StatusChip, RoleChip/UserStatusChip, Avatar, AdminTabs, *Modal. `lib/api.js` +
  `lib/format.js`. Client reads repo-root `.env` via Vite `envDir: '..'`.
- DB security helpers (SECURITY DEFINER, in the RLS + hardening migrations):
  `is_admin()`, `can_see_project_owner()`, `can_edit_project()`,
  `can_create_projects()`. Reuse these.
- `.env` (gitignored): Supabase URL + anon + service-role + access token,
  `APP_URL`, optional `ATTACHMENTS_BUCKET`.

## Session log (newest first)

- **2026-06-18** — Fixes, merged to `main` and **pushed** (`b8d06d9..7ab5f9a`,
  auto-deploys): (1) Add-update composer now closes after Post update
  (`TaskEditor.postUpdate` was missing `setComposing(false)`). (2) File viewer
  (`FileViewerModal`) gained a Full-screen toggle (100vw/100vh, scroll locked,
  Esc to close) and a Download button (Supabase `?download=` param so the
  cross-origin signed URL actually saves). (3) Fixed image cropping in full
  screen — flex `min-height:0`/`max-height:100%` so `object-fit:contain`
  letterboxes the whole image. Verified in the preview.
- **2026-06-18** — UI polish, all merged to `main` and **pushed** (auto-deploys to
  Vercel + Railway): project-list name is now a clickable link → View mode;
  Objective moved inside the white summary card; task updates redesigned as
  labeled LATEST/PREVIOUS boxes with full wrapped text; top bar shows
  MANIPAL logo (`client/public/logo.png`, on a white chip) + "Project Tracker"
  brand (home link) + project name; removed the "Projects (N)" list heading.
  Verified in the local preview. Pushed `93eb86a..99a2fae`.
- **2026-06-18** — Detail-page design fixes to match the reference mockup
  (`ProjectDetail.jsx`, `AppShell.jsx`, `TaskUpdateThread.jsx`, `styles.css`):
  (1) Objective moved inside the white summary card (divided from the facts).
  (2) Task updates redesigned as labeled LATEST/PREVIOUS boxes with full
  wrapped bodies — the old one-line nowrap predecessor was forcing the task
  table wide and getting clipped by the milestone card's `overflow:hidden`.
  (3) Top bar now shows logo + "Project Tracker" brand (home link) + project
  name; logo loads from `/logo.png` with a "PT" text fallback — **drop the real
  logo at `client/public/logo.png`** (no asset in repo yet). Verified in the
  preview. Merged `feature/detail-design-fixes` → `main`. Not yet pushed.
- **2026-06-18** — Made the project-list name clickable: it now renders as a
  link-styled button firing the existing `onOpen` handler, opening the project
  detail in View mode (the 👁 icon did this before). Client-only change
  (`ProjectList.jsx` + `.project-name-link` in `styles.css`). Verified in the
  local preview (logged in, clicked "AI Tools" → View detail). Merged
  `feature/clickable-project-name` → `main`. Not yet pushed (no auto-deploy until
  push). Blockers: none.
- **2026-06-18** — **Deployed to production** (Vercel + Railway + Supabase; auto-deploy
  on push to `main`). Reset the DB to a single admin login. Fixed three split-origin
  bugs the dev Vite proxy had masked: configurable `API_BASE` (+ prod default), the
  `AuthProvider` raw `fetch('/api/me')` now routes through `API_BASE`, and `cache:
  'no-store'` on API calls (a 304 was bouncing login). Locked CORS to the Vercel
  origin. All verified inside the deployed JS bundle. Merged to `main`. Blockers: none.
- **2026-06-17 (post-v1, perf)** — Reduced page latency on the two hot endpoints
  (server-side; client already parallelised). (1) Dropped the per-request
  `supabase.auth.getUser()` round-trip in `requireActiveUser` (~200ms each, on
  every call) — now decode the JWT `sub` locally and let the RLS profile read be
  the validity gate (PostgREST still verifies sig+expiry; expired → 401). (2)
  `GET /api/projects/:id`: users + parent lookups now run in the same parallel
  wave as milestones/tasks/files/subs, and the derived target is computed in
  memory from already-loaded rows (dropped the 2 `deriveTargets` queries) — ~6
  serial waves → 3. (3) `GET /api/projects`: users fetch parallel with
  `deriveTargets`. Verified in browser (data correct, no console errors).
  Investigated direct Postgres (DATABASE_URL): host is IPv6-only / `ENOTFOUND`
  even off the office network — not firewall-related; app speed is bounded by
  HTTPS round-trips to remote Supabase. Single-round-trip RPC option offered and
  declined for now (left as-is).
- **2026-06-17 (post-v1)** — Two fixes on `feature/update-edit`, merged to `main`.
  (1) Stuck save buttons: `setBusy(false)` only ran on error in SummaryEditor,
  MilestoneEditor, TaskEditor, UpdateComposer — moved to `finally`. (2) Editable
  latest task update (user-approved amendment to §13 append-only, latest entry
  only): migration `20260617100000_editable_latest_update.sql` (RLS
  `task_updates_update_latest` + `is_latest_task_update()` definer helper, applied
  over HTTPS), `PATCH /api/updates/:id`, "Edit latest update" UI. Verified in
  browser: in-place overwrite (entry count unchanged), non-latest edit → 403,
  prior history immutable. Decisions + schema mirror updated.
- **2026-06-17** — Built Phase 9 (Hardening): migration `…091000_hardening.sql`
  (viewer-exclude on projects INSERT via `can_create_projects()`; `security_invoker`
  on `project_target_dates`), applied over HTTPS and verified at the DB; added
  admin `audit_log` writes (`audit()` helper) for user + mapping changes; §20
  review pass recorded. Merged `feature/hardening` → `main`. **v1 build order
  complete.** Blockers: none.
- **2026-06-17** — Built Phase 8 (Admin Mappings): admin-gated
  `GET/POST/DELETE /api/admin/mappings`; picker + panel (summary, add/remove,
  self-map blocked, idempotent) + overview; Users/Mappings tabs. Verified
  visibility changes on grant/revoke. Merged `feature/admin-mappings`.
- **2026-06-17** — Built Phase 7 (Admin Users): admin user CRUD +
  invite-to-set-password + deactivate/reactivate w/ self-guard; Users tab UI;
  account-menu Admin wiring. Verified. Merged `feature/admin-users`.
- **2026-06-17** — Built Phase 6 (Sub-projects): add/link/unlink via
  PATCH/POST `parent_project_id` (+ depth trigger). Verified. Merged
  `feature/sub-projects`.
- **2026-06-17** — Built Phase 5 (Files): private bucket + setup:storage;
  server-mediated upload (type/size/scan-hook); signed-URL in-app viewer +
  download fallback. Verified. Merged `feature/files`.
- **2026-06-17** — Built Phase 4 (Detail Edit): write endpoints + §12.1/§19.1
  validation; editable summary, milestone/task CRUD + reorder, update composer.
  Verified. Merged `feature/detail-edit`.
- **2026-06-17** — Built Phase 3 (Detail View): detail tree endpoint, task-update
  thread (§13), routing w/ breadcrumb, AUTO target, status filter. Verified.
  Merged `feature/detail-view`.
- **2026-06-17** — Built Phase 2 (Project list): RLS-scoped list, derived target,
  filters/search, empty states, create modal. Verified. Merged
  `feature/project-list`.
- **2026-06-17** — Built Phase 1 (Auth & shell): login + §8.3 states, session,
  set-password, app shell, server-side inactive gate. Verified. Merged
  `feature/auth-shell`.
- **2026-06-17** — Built Phase 0 scaffolding. Schema + RLS + seed over the
  Management API. Verified. Merged `feature/phase-0-scaffolding`.
- **2026-06-16** — Kickoff. PRD v1 finalised; CLAUDE.md and SESSION_STATUS.md created. No code yet.
